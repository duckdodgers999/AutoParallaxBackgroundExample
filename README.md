This is a complete Android Studio project set up with one main activity, located in \app\src\main\java\central\test04, with the parallax background example from the andengine examples repo. You should be able to put any of the code from the examples repo into the MainActivity.java class and as long as the name of the class is "MainActivity" it will build all of the examples except for the box2d ones (use the code in the box2dtest repo for that).
